I am a first year PhD student at [INRIA Thoth](https://team.inria.fr/thoth/) under the supervision of [Julien Mairal](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/) and [Sergei Grudinin](https://team.inria.fr/nano-d/team-members/sergei-grudinin/). My research interest at the beginning of this PhD is to find optimal ways to represent materials structures through Graph and develop efficient algorithms to deal with it. On the side I'm highly interested in generalization and trustworthiness research topics especially in Computer Vision.

Prior to that, I worked for 2 years at [Imagia Cybernetics](https://imagiacanexia.com/fr/solutions-qui-favorisent-loncologie-de-precision/) as Applied Research Scientist in Deep Learning for Medical Imaging under the supervision of [Lisa Di Jorio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-di-jorio/?originalSubdomain=ca). During these fantastic years in industry I developed methods of Representation Learning (Self-supervised), Differential Privacy, Attention and Neural Architecture Search models for 2D X-ray, 3D CT imaging, video and gigapixel histology modalities. While conducting applied research on real world small datasets from hospitals, I focused on reproducibility, stability, robustness and generalization of my models.

Previously, I received a M.Eng. degree in applied mathematics and computer science from [CentraleSupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) in 2020. During my last year there I had great pleasure collaborating with [Pr Hugues Talbot](https://hugues-talbot.github.io/).

You can find my CV [here]({{site.baseurl}}{% link CV_JEHANNO_Emmanuel.pdf %}).

I also like sports a lot, including triathlon, soccer, hiking and sliding sports, [as you may see here](./another-page.html).
